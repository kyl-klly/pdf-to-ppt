# pdf-to-ppt
Made with LaTeX presentations in mind, turns pdfs into ppts.

This python script converts each page of a pdf into an image and then creates a ppt where each image gets its own slide.
The original motivation was for screen sharing on Zoom, with multiple users controlling the slides, and pdf files were not supported.
